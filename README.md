# Devtools Debugging Workshop
### DinosaurJS: June 16th, 2017 

This is a purposefully terribly-built application for the sake of demonstrating how to use Chrome's Developer Tools to debug even the gnarliest of codebases. Please do not use it as a reference for best practices and do not file issues or pull requests to improve it. IT IS BEAUTIFUL JUST THE WAY IT IS.


## Getting Started

`git clone https://github.com/brittanystoroz/dino-devtools.git`  
`npm install`  
`webpack --watch`  

In a new terminal window:

`npm start`  

You should see the app running on localhost:3000.
