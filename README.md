# Devtools Debugging Workshop
### DinosaurJS: June 16th, 2017 

This is a purposefully terribly-built application for the sake of demonstrating how to use Chrome's Developer Tools to debug even the gnarliest of codebases. Please do not use it as a reference for best practices and do not file issues or pull requests to improve it. IT IS BEAUTIFUL JUST THE WAY IT IS.

## Setup & Settings

1) Install [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html)

*Canary is a more beta release of the Chrome browser. It comes with the most bleeding-edge features that will eventually be released to the standard Chrome browser. Using Canary will allow us to play with new dev tools features before they are released.*

2) Understand your Dev Tools Settings

3) Clone This Practice Repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brittanystoroz/dino-devtools.git 
npm install
webpack --watch
npm start
```

*You should then see the app running on localhost:3000.*
